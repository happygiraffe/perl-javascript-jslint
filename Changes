    - Urgh.  Allow an empty string to be linted correctly.
    - Ensure the correct exit code comes out of the jslint command line tool.

    - Turn a fatal error into something more readable.  It happens that I
      missed a comment in the JSLint source pointing out that it returned
      nulls...
    - Allow passing in options to jslint().
    - Add in options to the jslint command line tool as well.
